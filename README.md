# Hypixel Bedwars

  This is a project which had the goal of re-creating a version of Hypixel Bedwars using the Spigot API and NMS in Minecraft version 1.8.9. For many of us, this was also our first
   major project, and thus a secondary, but equally important goal of this project was about learning Java, the Spigot API, and programming in general.
   As of current, the latest version of the project is stable and is playable if packaged, with a good amount of accuracy to the original version which was represented in Hypixel. 

   Since at the time of this project's creation we were Junior Developers, the code in the plugin is not optimal; There are many ways in which this code can be further improved,
   however as we have improved on our ability to program, we have gone through and revised the code multiple times in the past, and thus we are confident it should run decently on most systems.
