This file is a file for instructions in the game.
2 Config Files:

Teams, and World data
Teams are for specifying new teams, World Data is for Specifying data in the world.

To register a new team, use the following lines.
The lines must be written in order. Spaces are allowed.

TeamColor: color--
ForgeTime: Milliseconds (integer greater than 0) Spawn an item ~every n milliseconds, slightly randomized--
ForgeSpawn: x/y/z--
TeamSpawn: x/y/z/yaw--
Bed: x1,x2/y1,y2/z1,z2--
Chest: x/y/z--
QuickBuySpawn: x/y/z/yaw--

HealPoolArea: x1,x2/y1,y2/z1,z2---
TrapTriggerArea: x1,x2/y1,y2/z1,z2

Colors are: red, blue, yellow, white, aqua, gray, pink, green
Integers are whole numbers. E.g 1,120, 20
Teams should be unique. There should be no 2 red teams for example.

Coordinates like X,Y, and Z are decimal numbers or whole numbers. They are coordinates for
a position.
Yaw is a rotation. It follows the In-game Coordinates.


To specify a world, use the following:
The world name must be exactly the name of the world folder.
You would put this in the world data file.

World: world name

SpectatorSpawn: x/y/z

After specifying a world, in the same file, you can use the following to specify a generator spawn.

Spawn: x/y/z
RegisteredArea: x1,x2/y1,y2/z1,z2
