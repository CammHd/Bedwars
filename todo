Tracker:
Is a compass item with the string ChatColor.GOLD+"Tracker and Communication"

right clicking on it in the inventory does the following:
Opens up an inventory called "Trackers and Communication"

[ALPHA]
This inventory is a chest type inventory with 3 rows. (27 slots in total)
On the middle row, 
There are 2 items:

A compass called Tracking
A <we don't know what material, feather or paper maybe?> called Quick chat

Clicking on the COMPASS brings up another chest inventory, 4 rows deep.

0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
9   10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17
18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26
27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35

From slots 18 to 26, are black stained glass panes acting as separators.
On slot 31, is an arrow that returns you to [ALPHA] if right-clicked

From slots 10 to 16, are blocks of wool correlating to the opposing teams that are not eliminated. 
Clicking on a piece of wool does the following:
  checks if you have at least 2 emeralds in your inventory. If true, then removes 2 of them, and sets the compass in your inventory
  to track the closest player on that team.
  
  If the team is eliminated, the compass stops tracking them, and is reset.
  
  You can switch the current team you are tracking while you are already tracking a team.
  Dying will reset the compass, and you will be tracking no team.
  
  Don't worry about the Quick chat inventory for now. We'll do that later.

TNT, Fireballs

We did a few measurements on this, but we still don't have enough data. 
Leave off on this for now. We'll try doing this together maybe.
